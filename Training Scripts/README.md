If you want to run k-fold cross validation use the script `run_k_colf_CV.py`, if you want to use a predetermined division of data use `run_pre_divided_train_validation.py`.
You will have to manually alter paths in the scripts, you can also change which model to train on and hyperpameters.

If you want to alter the models or the dataloading alter the definitions in the file `helper_functions.py`.
