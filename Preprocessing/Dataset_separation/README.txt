ProThermDB:
Only entries that contained Tm-values and were properly clustered were divided into training and testing. Therefore there are entries marked to belong to the set '-'. Since the database is not that big there was no partition into a validation set. K-fold cross validation can be performed on the training set.

Leuenberger's data:
The test set was obtained from the data partition made in the paper ProTstab. Was only used for testing, therefore no entries were marked as training or validation.

Meltome:
The entries of the test set were obtained from the paper ProTstab. The division between training and validation was chosen randomly, without considerion of clustering.
