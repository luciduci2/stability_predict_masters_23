# Predicting Protein Stability with Machine Learning
**A Master's Project in Biophysical Chemistry.** You can find the thesis [here](http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/9139458).
This is still under construction. Last updated October 5th 2023


In this repo you can find:
  - Environment yml-file.
  - Raw databases and the used preprocessing scripts.
  - The training - validation - test separation of the databases.
  - Scripts used for training and validation.
  - The models and dataloaders used for training.

This is NOT included in the repo:
  - The developed models. The files were too large to uplad here and are instead stored by Ingemar Andr√©.
